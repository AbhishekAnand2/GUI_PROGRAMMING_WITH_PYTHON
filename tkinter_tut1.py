from tkinter import *

# instance of the Tk class
root = Tk() # this creates a basic gui or interface. In that basic gui we can add things
            # like Widgets (button, label etc)

# gui logic here


root.mainloop()
# mainloop puts you in the GUI and helps in making GUI interactive and also remembers the gui logic applied above.

# Question: What are the other ways to create gui in python rather than tkinter?
# Answer: Kivy, PyQt5, wxPython, Libavg, PySimpleGUI, PyForms, PyGUI, PySide2, Wax
